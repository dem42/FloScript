# FlowScript

FloScript is a android app that makes it easier to create scripts and small apps on your android device. 

The motivation behind FloScript is that the small phone and tablet screens aren't well suited for traditional coding so instead FloScript provides a flowchart IDE so that users can create scripts from flowchart elements. FloScript additionally includes a job execution system for scheduling script execution under various conditions.

FlowScript is open source, but it is also available for download on [Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.premature.floscript)
